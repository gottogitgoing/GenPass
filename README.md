# GenPass
A Bash script that generates a password based on the genpass function that is part of many Linux distributions. The script provides the added functionality of being able to set the length of a password, to include or exclude the use of special characters and to squeeze out consequtive identical characters.
 
 ## Installation
 Place the script genpass in a directory that is included in the $PATH variable. Aditionally if the function genpass has been defined in for example ~/.functions rename it to something else i.e. gen_pass.
